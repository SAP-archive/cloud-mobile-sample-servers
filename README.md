# Project Book

## Description

This repository contains three sample backend applications constructed for use with SAP Cloud Platform's Mobile Services SDKs. Each backend application provides a simple OData web service designed to help you explore the features of SAP's Mobile SDKs.  These applications can be deployed into your SAP Cloud Platform account and are designed to be used in conjunction with a SAP Mobile Services server.

The lab exercises are described in [Developer Project Book](Developer%20Project%20Book.ibooks) -- this document is provided in Apple iBook format. 

Prerequisites and recommendations for the Project Book are documented in the [Prerequisites](Prerequisites.md) file. You also will find a [References](References.md) file which contains links to various information and resources.

The Project Book is a summary of mobile use cases and sample backends for you to develop against. This should allow you to try out the [SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS](https://www.sap.com/developer/trials-downloads/additional-downloads/sap-cloud-platform-sdk-for-ios-14485.html) using live backend services.

### Material organization

The Project Book, References, and Prerequisites files are located in the top-level folder.

The sample backend Web IDE projects, including the OData-Service-defining CSDL files, are located in subfolders of the Backends/ directory.

Read-to-deploy archives of all three applications can be downloaded from the Releases tab of this GitHub repository.

### Feedback

Defects, questions, or other feedback can be posted using the Issue tab of this GitHub repository.

## Requirements

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository, including hardware and software, are detailed in the [Prerequisites](Prerequisites.md) file.


## Download and installation

To use the Project Book it is necessary to deploy the backend in your SAP Cloud Platform account. Currently only Neo deployments are supported as of this writing. The steps are described in the [Setup Neo](Backends/Setup%20Neo.md) file.
